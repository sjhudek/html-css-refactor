# Horiseon Website HTML CSS Refactoring

## Description
The website for the SEO company Horiseon needs to be updated to include semantic HTML, which will make the website meet ADA requirements, increase Search Engine Optimization, and easier to understand by screen readers used by the blind and vision-impaired. 

## Acceptance Criteria
* All HTML elements updated with semantic HTML tags including headings, paragraphs, and lists.
* The semantic HTML markup identifies the purpose and structure of the content. 
* Images have an "alt" tag that describes the purpose of the image.
